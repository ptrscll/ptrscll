Hi, I’m Peter Scully! I am a rising junior at Tufts University double majoring in computer science and geological sciences and minoring in computational chemistry. I’m interested in finding ways to apply computer science to other fields of science, particularly earth science. I have experience with C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I also have experience working with Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, and LaTeX.
