About Me
--------

Hi, I’m Peter Scully! I am a rising junior at Tufts University double majoring in computer science and geological sciences and minoring in computational chemistry. I’m interested in finding ways to apply computer science to other fields of science, particularly earth science. I have experience with C++, Java, Python, and Javascript. I also have experience with pair programming and Linux, Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, and LaTeX. I have some limited experience working with HTML, CSS, and QGIS.

My email is ptrscll@gmail.com. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to learn more about the projects I have worked on.

Projects
--------
I have a couple of public repositories, which are described below:
 - Advent-of-Code-2022: A repository featurining several of my solutions to Advent of Code's 2022 daily programming challenges. All solutions were written in Python
 - 24-Project: An android app I created in high school where users can play a modified version of the "24 Game" where they must use arithmetic operations to combine four numbers to reach 24. This app features three difficulty options and was programed in Java using Android Studio. I worked on this project as a part of my high school's science research program under the mentorship of Prof. Hao Wu at Southern Connecticut State University.


For my classes, I have also worked on several programming projects, which are described below:
 - MetroSim - A simulation of a subway line in C++  that I created for my Data Structures class. In the simulation, users can add passengers with specific destinations to individual stations and move a train to pick up and drop off passengers.
 - SudokuSolver - A program that solves a user-inputted sudoku puzzle using chronological backtracking search with forward checking. This program was written in Python for my Artificial Intelligence class.
 - Gerp - A C++ program that enables users to search for words in a directory of files using a modified version of the Unix grep command. Users can add specifications such as whether they want their search to be case-sensitive or case-insensitive. I wrote this program with Jane Brockett for my data structures class.
