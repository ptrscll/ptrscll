- Hi, I’m Peter Scully! I am currently a sophomore at Tufts University intending to double major in computer science and geological sciences and to minor in computational chemistry.
- I’m interested in finding ways to apply computer science to other fields of science, particularly the earth sciences and chemistry.
- I have experience with C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (and LaTeX)
- I have taken the following CS/CS-related courses:
  - AP Computing
  - CS 15 (Data Structures)
  - MATH 65 (Bridge to Higher Mathematics; similar to discrete mathematics)
- In Spring 2023, I will be taking:
  - CS 160 (Algorithms)
  - AST 51 (Astrophysics Laboratory, which involves a significant amount of programming)
  - MATH 70 (Linear Algebra) (possibly)
- My email is ptrscll@gmail.com - contact me if you would like to see the projects I have worked on that are currently in private repositories
